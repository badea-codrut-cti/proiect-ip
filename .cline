# Project Overview

This is a full-stack application for learning Japanese counting and counters using a Spaced Repetition System (SRS) with interactive exercises. The platform incorporates gamification elements (XP, levels, achievements) to make learning engaging and effective, similar to Bunpro but specifically focused on Japanese counters.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Express.js** (v5.2.1) with ES modules (`"type": "module"`)
- **PostgreSQL** database with `pg` driver
- **Custom authentication service** (`AuthService` class in `db.js`) with session management
- **Zod** for validation
- **bcrypt** for password hashing
- **nodemailer** for email functionality
- **Jest** for testing with Supertest

### Frontend
- **React** (v19.2.1) with TypeScript
- **React Router** (v7.10.1) for routing
- **shadcn/ui** component library with Tailwind CSS
- **Lucide React** for icons
- **Vite** as build tool

### Infrastructure
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** for containerization
- **PostgreSQL** (v15) as database service
- **MailHog** for email testing in development

## Database Conventions

### Migrations
- Migration scripts are stored in `backend/migrations/`
- Each migration creates or modifies database tables
- **Important**: When adding new columns to existing tables, create a new migration file with `ALTER TABLE` statements instead of modifying existing migrations
- Migration files follow the pattern: `CREATE_*_TABLES.sql`
- All migrations use `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for idempotency

### Database Schema Highlights
- **users**: User accounts with XP, FSRS parameters, and contributor/admin flags
- **counters**: Japanese counter definitions
- **card_state**: SRS state for user-counter pairs (FSRS algorithm)
- **exercises**: Interactive exercises for practicing counters
- **reviews**: Review history for spaced repetition
- **counter_edits**: Edit proposals for counter documentation
- **contributor_applications**: Applications for contributor status

## Code Style Guidelines

### Backend
- Use ES module syntax (`import/export`)
- Route handlers are organized in `backend/routes/`
- Services contain business logic in `backend/services/`
- Middleware for authentication in `backend/middleware/`
- Use Zod for input validation
- Follow existing patterns for error handling and response formatting

### Frontend
- Use TypeScript with strict typing
- Components follow shadcn/ui patterns
- Route definitions in `frontend/app/routes.ts`
- UI components in `frontend/app/components/ui/`
- Utility functions in `frontend/app/lib/utils.ts`
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with CSS variables

## Development Workflow

### Running the Application
1. Use `docker-compose up --build` to start all services
2. Frontend: http://localhost:5173
3. Backend API: http://localhost:5000
4. PostgreSQL: localhost:5432
5. MailHog UI: http://localhost:8025

### Testing
- Backend: `cd backend && npm test`
- Frontend: `cd frontend && npm test`
- Docker tests: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --build`

## Application Purpose & Features

### Core Learning System
- Spaced Repetition System (FSRS algorithm) for memorizing Japanese counters
- Interactive exercises with sentence generation and counter practice
- Progressive difficulty with decimal points and count ranges

### Gamification Elements
- XP system for completed reviews and exercises
- Contributor system for community content creation
- Achievement system (implied by XP and progression)

### Community Features
- Users can apply to become contributors
- Contributors can create and edit counter exercises
- Moderation system for approving user-generated content

### User Progression
- Personalizable retention goals (`desired_retention`)
- Adaptive scheduling based on performance
- Review history and statistics tracking

## Important Notes for AI Assistance

1. **Database Changes**: Always create new migration files for schema changes; never modify existing migrations
2. **Code Consistency**: Follow existing patterns in the codebase for similar functionality
3. **No Comments**: Do not add code comments unless they explain non-obvious business logic
4. **Type Safety**: Maintain TypeScript type safety in frontend code
5. **Error Handling**: Follow existing error response patterns in the backend
6. **Authentication**: Use the existing custom `AuthService` class for authentication and session management
7. **Testing**: Ensure new features include appropriate tests following existing patterns
